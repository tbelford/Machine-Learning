To run my code, I used Carnegie Melon's RL_Simulator found here: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/

I have uploaded the necessary files to my Github page found here:
https://github.com/tbelford/Machine-Learning/tree/master/p4

Please note that the two mazes I used were custom made and are not present
in the original RL_Sim. They can be found on my GitHub under p4, in the folder
RL_Sim and then inside the "mazes" folder. To run tests, simply download my 
RL_Sim folder and run the command "java -jar rl_sim.jar" when your terminal has
the RL_sim folder downloaded.
Note: if you downloaded RL_sim from the link above, be sure to download the 
two maze files I created to get the same mazes. small.maze = the small one, 
big.maze = the large one

When running a test, first select the algorithm and then load one of the 
two mazes I made into it by clicking "Load Maze". Then choose the parameters 
and click "Execute" for VI and PI, and "Cycles" for Q-Learning. 
Please feel free to reach out to me if there are any issues testing the code.
