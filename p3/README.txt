This project was designed to learn more about unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering
and dimensionality reduction.

The data used was taken from the UCI machine learning repository.
spam dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase
heart disease dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

My python code was heavily based on the kylewest520 github
link: https://github.com/kylewest520/CS-7641---Machine-Learning/tree/master/Assignment%203%20Unsupervised%20Learning

All of my code and files can be found on my public github repository:
https://github.com/tbelford/Machine-Learning/tree/master/p3

I strongly recommend using the ipython notebook file on Jupyter or a similar application. 
This will allow you to both run all and run only certain portions of the file. 
If you can't, then simply run the provided python file (but I strongly recommend using Jupyter). 

mlp3.ipynb is the recommended file
mlp3.py is the python file


(note: i believe my results can be seen if you just open the mlp3.ipynb file on Github and let it open up there)
